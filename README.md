# Image-style-transfer
For a given content image and a style image, the outline and shape of the image are similar to the content image, and the color or texture is changed to be similar to the style image.

The aim of this assignment is to create a deep learning model capable of adapting an existing work to resemble the aesthetic of any art. The model should be able to analyze the artistic style of the selected art and apply similar stylistic features to a new, original artwork, creating a piece that seems as though it could have been created by the artist themselves.
